# Siddhivinayak Temple Management System - Project Report

## 1. Executive Summary

The Siddhivinayak Temple Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to digitize and streamline the operations of Hindu temples, with a specific focus on Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai, India. This system addresses multiple challenges faced by traditional temple management practices, including long queues for darshan (deity viewing), inefficient donation processes, and limited accessibility for devotees who cannot physically visit the temple.

Built using Streamlit for the frontend and MySQL for database management, this project showcases advanced SQL implementation with a focus on relational database design, complex querying, and data visualization. The system demonstrates practical applications of database management systems in religious institutions and cultural heritage sites, bringing traditional practices into the digital era.

The project offers several core modules including darshan booking, online donations, virtual puja services, prasadam (sacred food offering) ordering, visitor management, and an administrative dashboard for temple authorities. It prioritizes user experience while ensuring robust backend functionality through well-structured database operations.

## 2. Project Background and Objectives

## 5. Database Implementation Details

### 5.1 Schema Design and Normalization

The database schema follows normalization principles to minimize redundancy while optimizing for common query patterns:

- **First Normal Form (1NF)**: All tables have a primary key, and all columns contain atomic values.
- **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
- **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: No transitive dependencies exist between non-key attributes.

For example, visitor information is stored in a centralized Visitors table and referenced by booking records, rather than duplicating visitor details across multiple booking entries.

### 5.2 Key Relationships and Constraints

The schema implements several types of relationships:

- **One-to-Many**: A temple has many darshan types; a visitor can make many bookings
- **Many-to-Many**: Festivals and darshan types (resolved through junction tables)
- **Self-Referential**: Not heavily utilized in this implementation, but structures allow for it

Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity across the database, preventing orphaned records or inconsistent states.

### 5.3 Advanced SQL Features Utilized

The implementation demonstrates several advanced SQL techniques:

- **Parameterized Queries**: To prevent SQL injection
- **Transaction Management**: For operations that modify multiple tables
- **Complex JOINs**: Retrieving related data across multiple tables
- **Subqueries**: For complex data retrieval operations
- **Window Functions**: For analytics in the admin dashboard
- **Dynamic SQL**: For custom reporting capabilities
- **Aggregation**: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX for statistical analysis
- **Conditional Logic**: CASE statements for data transformation
- **Date and Time Functions**: For scheduling and reporting
- **String Manipulation**: For formatting outputs and generating references

### 5.4 Data Integrity and Security

The system implements several measures to ensure data integrity:

- **Constraint Enforcement**: Foreign keys, NOT NULL constraints, unique constraints
- **Transaction Boundaries**: Ensuring operations either fully complete or fully roll back
- **Input Validation**: Both at application and database levels
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of database exceptions
- **Audit Trails**: Tracking key operations with timestamps and user references
